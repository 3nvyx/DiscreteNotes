1. Set Definition:
   A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects or elements.
   Example: A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
   - The objects in a set are called elements or members.
   - Sets are usually denoted by curly braces, e.g., A = {a, b, c}.

2. Subset Definition:
   A subset is a set that contains only elements that are also in another set.
   - If set B is a subset of set A, it means every element of B is also an element of A.
   - Notation: B ⊆ A (read as "B is a subset of A").
   - Example: If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3}, then B ⊆ A.

3. Proper Subset:
   A proper subset of a set A is a subset of A that is not equal to A.
   - Notation: B ⊂ A (read as "B is a proper subset of A").
   - Example: If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2}, then B ⊂ A.

4. Power Set:
   The power set of a set A is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.
   - Notation: P(A).
   - Example: If A = {1, 2}, then P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}.
   - The number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n.

5. Universal Set:
   The universal set is the set that contains all elements under consideration for a particular discussion.
   - Denoted by U.
   - All other sets in a given problem are subsets of the universal set.

6. Set Operations:
   - Union ( ∪ ): A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.
   - Intersection ( ∩ ): A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.
   - Difference ( - ): A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}.
   - Complement ( A' ): A' = {x | x ∈ U and x ∉ A}.

1. Power Set Definition:
   The power set of a set A is the set of all possible subsets of A, including the empty set and A itself.
   Notation: P(A) or 2^A.

2. Example:
   For A = {1, 2}, P(A) = { {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2} }.

3. Number of Subsets:
   If A has n elements, P(A) has 2^n subsets.
   Example: For A = {1, 2}, P(A) has 2^2 = 4 subsets.

4. Key Points:
   - Includes the empty set and A itself.
   - Number of subsets grows exponentially: 2^n subsets for a set of n elements.

5. Application:
   Used in combinatorics, computer science, and logic to represent all possible subsets or combinations.

6. Larger Example:
   For A = {a, b, c}, P(A) = { {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c} } (8 subsets).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3 Unions
1. **Union of Sets**:
   - The union of two sets A and B, denoted A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are in A, in B, or in both.
   - Notation: A ∪ B.
   - Example: If A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3}.

2. **Intersection of Sets**:
   - The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are in both A and B.
   - Notation: A ∩ B.
   - Example: If A = {1, 2} and B = {2, 3}, then A ∩ B = {2}.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Union (∪)**: Combines all elements from both sets without repetition.
   - **Intersection (∩)**: Contains only the common elements between both sets.

4. **Properties**:
   - A ∪ B = B ∪ A (Commutative Property).
   - A ∩ B = B ∩ A (Commutative Property).
   - A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C (Associative Property).
   - A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C (Associative Property).
   - A ∪ ∅ = A (Union with empty set).
   - A ∩ ∅ = ∅ (Intersection with empty set).
----------------------------
1. **Union and Intersection of Multiple Sets**:

   - **Union of Multiple Sets**:
     - When you have a sequence of sets, the union is the set of all elements that are in at least one of the sets.
     - Notation: ∪_{i=1}^n A_i means the union of sets A_1, A_2, ..., A_n.
     - Example: ∪_{i=1}^3 A_i = A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3.
       - This represents the union of the first three sets.

   - **Intersection of Multiple Sets**:
     - When you have a sequence of sets, the intersection is the set of all elements that are common to every set.
     - Notation: ∩_{i=1}^n A_i means the intersection of sets A_1, A_2, ..., A_n.
     - Example: ∩_{i=1}^3 A_i = A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3.
       - This represents the intersection of the first three sets.

2. **General Notation for Sequences**:
   - If you have an infinite sequence of sets, you can use a similar notation:
     - ∪_{i=1}^∞ A_i represents the union of all sets A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., and so on indefinitely.
     - ∩_{i=1}^∞ A_i represents the intersection of all sets A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., and so on indefinitely.

3. **Examples**:

   - Union Example:
     ∪_{i=1}^4 A_i = A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3 ∪ A_4
     - This is the union of the first four sets.

   - Intersection Example:
     ∩_{i=1}^5 A_i = A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 ∩ A_4 ∩ A_5
     - This is the intersection of the first five sets.

4. **Empty Set in Sequences**:
   - If any of the sets in the sequence is the empty set (∅), it can affect the union or intersection:
     - Union with an empty set: A ∪ ∅ = A.
     - Intersection with an empty set: A ∩ ∅ = ∅ (the result is the empty set).

5. **General Properties**:
   - Union is **associative** and **commutative**: 
     - (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C) and A ∪ B = B ∪ A.
   - Intersection is **associative** and **commutative**:
     - (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C) and A ∩ B = B ∩ A.

6. **De Morgan’s Laws for Sequences**:
   - For infinite sequences of sets:
     - (∪_{i=1}^n A_i)' = ∩_{i=1}^n A_i' (The complement of a union is the intersection of the complements).
     - (∩_{i=1}^n A_i)' = ∪_{i=1}^n A_i' (The complement of an intersection is the union of the complements).

----------------------------------------------
1. **Set Difference**:
   - The set difference of two sets A and B, denoted A - B, is the set of all elements that are in A but not in B.
   - Notation: A - B.
   - Example: If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, then A - B = {1}.
   - The result of A - B excludes any elements that are in both A and B.
   - **Key Property**: A - B = A ∩ B' (A minus B is the intersection of A and the complement of B).

2. **Symmetric Difference (⊕ )**:
   - The symmetric difference of two sets A and B, denoted A ⊕ B or A ⊖ B, is the set of all elements that are in either A or B but not in both.
   - Notation: A ⊕ B.
   - Example: If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}, then A ⊕ B = {1, 4}.
   - It can also be expressed as: A ⊕ B = (A - B) ∪ (B - A), meaning the union of the set differences A - B and B - A.
   - **Key Property**: A ⊕ B = (A ∪ B) - (A ∩ B) (The symmetric difference is the union of A and B minus their intersection).

3. **Key Properties**:
   - **Set Difference**:
     - A - B ≠ B - A (The difference is not commutative).
     - A - ∅ = A (Subtracting the empty set from A gives A).
   - **Symmetric Difference**:
     - A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A (Symmetric difference is commutative).
     - A ⊕ B = ∅ if A = B (The symmetric difference of equal sets is the empty set).
     - A ⊕ ∅ = A (Symmetric difference with the empty set gives A).

4. **Application**:
   - **Set Difference**: Useful for finding elements that are unique to one set.
   - **Symmetric Difference**: Used for finding elements that are in either set but not in both (e.g., in error detection, comparing datasets).

+------------------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

1. **Cartesian Product**:
   - The **Cartesian product** of two sets A and B, denoted A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.
   - Notation: A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B}.

2. **Example**:
   - Let A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y}.
   - The Cartesian product A × B is:
     A × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)}.

3. **General Cartesian Product**:
   - For n sets A1, A2, ..., An, the Cartesian product is the set of all ordered n-tuples.
   - Notation: A1 × A2 × ... × An.
   - Example: If A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y}, then A × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)}.

4. **Properties of Cartesian Products**:
   - **Commutative Property**: In general, A × B ≠ B × A. The order of the sets matters in the Cartesian product.
   - **Associative Property**: (A × B) × C = A × (B × C). Cartesian product is associative.
   - **Size of Cartesian Product**: If A has m elements and B has n elements, the size of A × B is m × n.
     - Example: If A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y, z}, then A × B = {(1, x), (1, y), (1, z), (2, x), (2, y), (2, z)}. The size is 2 × 3 = 6.

5. **Cartesian Product with More Than Two Sets**:
   - If A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y}, and C = {a, b}, the Cartesian product A × B × C is:
     A × B × C = {(1, x, a), (1, x, b), (1, y, a), (1, y, b), (2, x, a), (2, x, b), (2, y, a), (2, y, b)}.
   
6. **Application**:
   - Cartesian products are used in:
     - **Database theory**: To form combinations of data from multiple tables.
     - **Coordinate geometry**: To represent points in multi-dimensional spaces.
     - **Combinatorics**: For counting combinations of elements from different sets.
