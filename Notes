Sets
  Set is a collection of objects; (duplcates not allowed)
    Denoted by capital letters - A,B, X, Y,...
    Elements of a set denoted by lowercase letters 

Propositional Logic
  Proposition is astatement that is either true of false. 
  Negation is denoted for propositions that are not true. To negate is to make the statement the oppsite state of the Proposition. 
  ~ is false 
Conjunction
  --> learn terms for conjunction. 
  Symbol: ∧ Def: And
  Symbol: ∨ Def: Or
  ⊕. It can also be written as EOR, EXOR, or ⊻ Def: Excljusive or

Conditional statement is also implication. 
  --Many ways to express conditional statement: p -> q
- Converse: q → p
  - The converse of a conditional statement switches the positions of the hypothesis and conclusion.
  - Example: If p → q, then the converse is q → p.

- Contrapositive: ~q → ~p
  - The contrapositive of a conditional statement negates both the hypothesis and conclusion, then switches their positions.
  - Example: If p → q, then the contrapositive is ~q → ~p.

- Inverse: ~p → ~q
  - The inverse of a conditional statement negates both the hypothesis and conclusion without switching their positions.
  - Example: If p → q, then the inverse is ~p → ~q.
- Conditional Statement: If it is raining, then I close the windows. (p → q)
  - p: It is raining.
  - q: I close the windows.

- Converse: If I close the windows, then it is raining. (q → p)

- Contrapositive: If I do not close the windows, then it is not raining. (~q → ~p)

- Inverse: If it is not raining, then I do not close the windows. (~p → ~q)
